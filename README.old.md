# b-web-challenge

**The main objective of this challenge is to see how familiar you are with web technologies,
for that you are going to build a Tic Tac Toe Game.**

## Notes
There is no cross browser compatibility requirements, you can use all the new features available

## Functionality
What we expect the game to do
* have a different symbol for each player (feel free to use any symbol/letter)
* have a reset button (it will force the game into the initial state)
* recognize when someone wins the game and throw an alert with his name or symbol
* recognize when the game ends in a draw and throw an alert with that information
* automatically reset the board 10 seconds after the game ends on either condition (winning, draw)

## Bonus points:
* we do not ask for a specific design, but please, make it a bit pretty
* using correct html markup
* avoiding style duplications
* only access the Dom when you really need to
* change the background color when the screen size is smaller (mobile size) :hint(media queries)
* implement a better way to display the winner/draw than a simple alert (there is no limits here, use your imagination)
* implement a visible countdown for the reset timer (after a game ends)
